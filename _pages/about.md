Pan-Education for Legal Cognitive Awareness: Human-Computer Interaction on Personal Data and Privacy Protection in Applications

**Qinrui Li**      *tutored by David D. Joyner, Fandi Peng*

- My research centered on examining user privacy challenges in device application interactions. We introduced a legal education mechanism that incorporates metacognition and cognitive awareness through human-computer interaction methods to assist users in making informed privacy-related decisions. Experimental validation confirmed the effectiveness of this model in achieving legal education objectives.

HCI-Based Research on Rehabilitation Training Methods for Dyslexia

**Qinrui Li**, Bin Yuan, Qianqian Wang

- This research is primarily focused on individuals, especially children with reading and language disabilities. Addressing the issues related to unclear text resolution, an intricate pronunciation system, and incoherent spelling encountered during the language learning process, our product proposes an interactive and progressive pedagogical framework. It integrates software and hardware components to ensure the pedagogical experience's scientific validity and effectiveness.

[**Project**](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1865/4/042117/meta) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='13'></span></strong>
- In pursuit of effective vehicle type identification within intelligent transportation systems, this study introduces a deep learning model for vehicle classification based on transfer learning theory, leveraging the Inception V3 model as its foundation. Both theoretical analysis and experimental outcomes demonstrate superior performance when compared to vehicle classification models based on VGG-16, Xception, and Resnet-50. The experimental results showcase a training accuracy exceeding 96.48% and a test accuracy surpassing 83.86%, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

[Image Super-resolution Algorithm based on Deep Learning Network](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QM9kv2UAAAAJ&citation_for_view=QM9kv2UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C)

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=QM9kv2UAAAAJ&citation_for_view=QM9kv2UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='5'></span></strong>
- In our research, we introduced a novel image super-resolution algorithm, RDSRCNN, based on deep learning networks. This algorithm utilizes different-sized convolution kernels to enhance the extraction of fine details from low-resolution images. We employed convolution layers with ELU activation functions to build a residual network, mitigating the gradient vanishing problem, promoting feature reuse, and reducing network redundancy. With performance improved 3.27%.

PlastiProphet: An Environmental Bearing Capacity Model of Plastic Waste Based on Computational Intelligence

**Qinrui Li**, Zhuojun Xiao, Kainan Xue

- We developed a lightweight neural network model, the BCPW Model, for numerical prediction. The model was built using nonlinear regression, analytic hierarchy process, TOPSIS entropy weight method, and logistic regression. Data were collected from 54 countries across various dimensions, and a rigorous selection process in MATLAB identified the top 16 correlated indicators for evaluation. Additionally, I conducted extensive data mining on pollutant emission data spanning two decades to train the Bearing Capacity of Plastic Waste (BCPT) model.
